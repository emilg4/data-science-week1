WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Emil Lagasca]
Date: [12/2]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Capitalisation and correct strings)
-------------------------
Brief description: [Many variables differ in either their capitalisation or typos]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 1,checking strings]

Which variable(s) affected: [site,treatment,collector]

Why this is important to fix: [This will make it easier to create plots so there 
are less differing variables caused by these typos]

What I plan to do: [I will first check what type of typos there are for each variable
and then i will adjust them by either adding capitalisation to them or by 
replacing the values with the correct one]



ISSUE 2 (Duplicates)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [Some entries are duplicated]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 4, duplicates]

Which variable(s) affected: [All variables since it has duplicated entries]

Why this is important to fix: [This is because it may affect means, medians 
and other statistical measurements]

What I plan to do: [Find the duplicates and determine if it is okay to remove
the duplicates]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - Missing data, i am not what to do with them, if i should delete them
or if there is a way to insert data scientifically?]
- [Issue 4 - Negative body mass, i am not sure what to do with this, probably just make it positive]
- [Issue 5 - decided to leave as-is because...] ???


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. How do the different types of missing data MCAR, MAR, and MNAR determine
the strategy i will use to deal with them?

2. What can i do with negative values or should i just make it positively

3.
